        predep (list[str]): List of commands to execute before deploying.
        postdep (list[str]): List of commands to execute after deploying.
        host (str): Host to perform the deployment in. Required.
        user (str): User to use for the deployment. Required.
        use_password (bool): Whether or not to use password. If set to ``False``
            (default), will rely on public key authentication. Otherwise, it
            will be asked for during deployment or may be configured through the
            ``password`` attribute.

            be used to specify the password used for the connection. Otherwise
            it will be asked for during deployment.
        deploy_path (str): Remote host path in which to deploy files. Required.
        host_tmp (str): In ``local`` deployments, the remote directory to use
            for uploading the compressed files (defaults to ``'/tmp'``).
        keep_max (int): Maximum revisions to keep in the remote server.
        local_ignore (list[str]): List of files (or directories) to ignore in
            ``local`` deployments.
        buffer_size (int): Buffer size (in bytes) for file copying in ``local``
            deployments. Defaults to 1 MB.
